Colmar Academy Website

Class project for Codecademy website building class

Design Choices:

- Content:
   - Headings: sentence capitalized
- Fonts:
   - Oxygen. Cuz I like the way it looks
- Colors:
   - Text color: dark gray which isn't as harsh as black
   - Generated color palette which is mostly monochromatic
       - Changed logo colors to look nice on header background
- Transitions:
   - Used only in a few in strategic places
- Accessibility:
   - Most images didn't add anything to the presentation (in my opinion), so I used blank alt tags in those cases
